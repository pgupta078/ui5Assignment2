# Application dev/execution via index.html flow is as below
Index.html -> index.js ->view  ->View Controller
# Button press method is defined in the controller of the view.
# In the view  - if press button method is defined using a dot (.) …
       this means it will go and search in the related controller (controller which is declared in the view)
       controls under control are known aggregations  - for exp – cells in table  or view element in a panel  –if you destroy parent . child is destroyed   
# Association 
       is like one control is linked to other control but not a child
# Xml - structured data   - group of tags with attributes and its elements 
# Json – similar to JS objects knows as JS object notation
# Sap.ui.define helps to define module
# “use strict”  -  
         need to declare the variable before you can use it.
